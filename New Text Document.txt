## Project Workflow: IQ Option Stock Market Alert with Telegram Image Notification  

### 1. Initialization & Setup  
- Obtain & authenticate IQ Option API with your API key.  
- Set up the Telegram bot and obtain its API token.  
- Create a database or dictionary to store user-defined market price conditions.  

### 2. Fetch Stock Market Data  
- Connect to the **IQ Option API** to fetch real-time stock market prices.  
- Define a loop to fetch stock price data at a fixed interval (e.g., every second or minute).  
- Store & track historical data if needed.  

### 3. User Input & Monitoring  
- Allow users to:  
  - Select stock symbols (e.g., AAPL, TSLA, etc.).  
  - Set target price levels (e.g., notify when AAPL reaches $200).  
  - Provide image preferences for Telegram notifications.  
  - Choose Telegram groups for notifications.  

### 4. Price Condition Checking  
- Continuously compare real-time stock prices with user-defined thresholds.  
- When a stock price **matches or exceeds the target**, trigger the next step.  

### 5. Image Generation  
- Generate an image dynamically based on:  
  - Stock data (e.g., price, time, trend).  
  - User-selected themes or predefined templates.  
- Use AI-based image generation (e.g., DALL·E, Stable Diffusion) or pre-defined chart templates.  

### 6. Sending Notifications to Telegram  
- Format the alert message with:  
  - Stock symbol & current price.  
  - Time of alert.  
  - The generated image.  
- Send the alert to the **user’s specified Telegram group**.  

### 7. Logging & Continuous Monitoring  
- Log alerts for future reference.  
- Continue monitoring the stock market for new alerts.
